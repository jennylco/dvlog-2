Museum of History
Building was built in 1989- it is one of the newest museums.
Conservation and preparation labs. 
Conservators- papers, textiles, archeology, objects- they also document the condition of the objects when they are received and when they go out for loan. How have they been treated in the past?
Object labs- can have ceramics
Preparation and conservators work together a lot to make sure that the way the objects are stored is safe for the objects.
Paint, wood shop, reproduction room, etc. 
Temperature controlled rooms for artifacts.
Carbon dioxide bubbles for a few weeks to help kill anything that attached itself to the object prior to arrival. Everything is quarantined. 
Canoe room- they do work with the various aboriginal tribes to change the names as they are notified and are mindful on how their objects are portrayed to the public and how they are stored. Everything is labelled by tribe and if they have the creator then that gets added to the label too as well as the location in which the object was found. Older terminology remains in the database because it is part of the records, but the name on display will be changed based on the current cultural affiliation. They are always updating based on the information received. Cataloging. Changing approaches to indigenous relationships with the institutions. They are always playing “Catch up” when they are adding the new terminology to their database. There is only a few who are updating the database so they are constantly working on updates. Their collections are also so integrated. How do you connect pictures, objects, textiles, etc in one database? This shows that the museum is actively working with various indigenous groups.
